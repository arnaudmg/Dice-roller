# Dice-roller
My first Javascript school project. Making a dice roller. Parts of Bruno Simon's lessons I have at HETIC.
The goal of this exercise was to make at least Dice Roller. I decided to go one step further and try to draw a mathematical conclusion. Here, I'm trying to determine the average value that the script will return to us if we ask it to give us a number between 1 and 6 (inclusive)
